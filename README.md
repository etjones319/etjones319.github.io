# Confier Project

This is a re-design of an Employee Demographic Form
It was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on top of the Foundation 6 framework
The intention of this project was to create a more engaging web form application that is responsive
Feel free to view this on multiple screen sizes

NOTE: This is primarily a Design - it has the hooks to be used as a full on web applciation, but is just a skeleton in its current iteration.  For example, all Audit Links will take you to the same audit screen, there is field validation, etc.  This is something that could be very easily added in the future.
