# Confier Project

This is a re-design of an Employee Demographic Form.
It was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on top of the Foundation 6 framework.
The intention of this project was to create a more engaging web form application that is responsive.
Feel free to view this on multiple screen sizes.

NOTE: This is primarily a design - it has the hooks to be used as a full on web application, but is just a skeleton in its current iteration.  For example, all Audit Links will take you to the same sample audit popup/screen, there is no field validation, etc.  This is something that could be very easily added in the future.
